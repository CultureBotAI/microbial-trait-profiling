# Six Shared Traits Sankeys

These outputs render the six pooled paired-contrast traits with `q_value <= 0.001` as two combined condition-to-body-site Sankey maps plus readability variants and twelve individual trait-direction Sankey maps.

## Inputs

- Profile counts: `data/derived/study_trait_profiles_wide.tsv`
- Human profile metadata: `trait-visualization/study_trait_profile_study_metadata.tsv`
- Paired trait statistics: `trait-visualization/trait-profile-investigation/trait_profile_paired_contrast_trait_stats.tsv`

## Scoring

For each trait, raw KG-Microbe trait counts were divided by the profile's total trait signal, scaled per 1,000 counts, log1p-transformed, and standardized to z-scores across the human-host profile universe used by the existing study trait profile maps. Each trait is then treated as a one-trait guild.

## Combined Readability Variants

- `combined_direction`: all-edge overlay for one profile direction, with same-color links bundled into one summed trunk per body site.
- `combined_trait_lanes`: option 1; one figure per direction with six stacked trait lanes, preserving all displayed trait-specific links while separating line crossings by trait.
- `combined_shared_high_support`: option 2; one reduced overlay per direction, limited to the top 12 condition/body-site pairs selected from pairs shared by at least 3 traits or with at least 30 positive-z focus profiles.
- `combined_individual_conditions`: one figure per direction with raw individual condition labels on the left and grouped v3 body-site labels on the right. Same-trait records from one condition into one body-site group are summed into a single colored link, then bundled into one body-site trunk per trait color.
- `single_trait_direction`: individual one-trait, one-direction Sankeys.

The combined maps retain the individual trait-direction edge records. Every colored curve in the combined maps is a trait-specific condition/body-site link. The individual maps show one trait and one profile direction per figure. Curve width is the focus-direction positive-z profile count for that trait and shade is the mean positive focus-profile z-score. The overlay maps use the same numeric color range for all six trait-specific monochrome scales. Light grey underlays show the z <= 0 background for the same condition/body-site/trait link. Parallel curves sharing a condition/body-site pair are ordered by edge width from thickest to thinnest. In `combined_direction` and `combined_individual_conditions`, links approaching each body-site node merge into at most six colored trunks, one per trait color scale.

Image node keys spell out the compact labels used in the PNGs: `n=` is positive-z focus-profile support, `s=` is the unique study count for `n`, `bg=` is z <= 0 background-profile support, `links=` is plotted trait-specific link count, and `traits=` is the number of distinct traits represented at a combined-map node.

Node counts are profile-trait memberships across displayed links, not deduplicated profile totals. Use the edge TSVs for exact trait-specific counts, study IDs, raw rolled-up labels, and increased-minus-decreased contrasts.

## Cytoscape Graph Explorer

- Interactive graph explorer: `six_shared_traits_profile_graphs.html`
- Inline graph data audit copy: `six_shared_traits_profile_graph_data.json`
- Graph manifest: `six_shared_trait_graph_manifest.tsv`

The graph explorer uses Cytoscape.js from jsDelivr and includes four views: increased/decreased grouped conditions and increased/decreased individual conditions. Each source condition link connects to a trait/body-site bundle node, then each bundle connects to the body-site node as one summed trait-colored trunk.

| view | condition nodes | body-site nodes | trait/body-site bundles | source edges | trunks |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Increased, grouped conditions | 19 | 15 | 73 | 188 | 73 |
| Decreased, grouped conditions | 17 | 14 | 71 | 185 | 71 |
| Increased, individual conditions | 23 | 12 | 50 | 117 | 50 |
| Decreased, individual conditions | 23 | 11 | 52 | 105 | 52 |

## Static Cytoscape-Inspired PNG Graphs

- Manifest: `six_shared_trait_static_graph_manifest.tsv`

These PNGs are graph versions of the six shared trait Sankey views. They use six central trait hubs rather than condition-to-body-site flow bands, so they are meant to communicate the condition-trait and trait-body-site network structure in a Cytoscape-style static layout.
