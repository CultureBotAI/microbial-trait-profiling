# Six Shared Traits Sankeys

These outputs render the six pooled paired-contrast traits with `q_value <= 0.001` as two combined condition-to-body-site Sankey maps and twelve individual trait-direction Sankey maps.

## Inputs

- Profile counts: `data/derived/study_trait_profiles_wide.tsv`
- Human profile metadata: `trait-visualization/study_trait_profile_study_metadata.tsv`
- Paired trait statistics: `trait-visualization/trait-profile-investigation/trait_profile_paired_contrast_trait_stats.tsv`

## Scoring

For each trait, raw KG-Microbe trait counts were divided by the profile's total trait signal, scaled per 1,000 counts, log1p-transformed, and standardized to z-scores across the human-host profile universe used by the existing study trait profile maps. Each trait is then treated as a one-trait guild.

## Combined Readability Variants

- `combined_direction`: original all-edge overlay for one profile direction.
- `combined_trait_lanes`: option 1; one figure per direction with six stacked trait lanes, preserving all displayed trait-specific links while separating line crossings by trait.
- `combined_shared_high_support`: option 2; one reduced overlay per direction, limited to the top 12 condition/body-site pairs selected from pairs shared by at least 3 traits or with at least 30 positive-z focus profiles.
- `single_trait_direction`: individual one-trait, one-direction Sankeys.

The combined maps retain the individual trait-direction edge records. Every colored curve in the combined maps is a trait-specific condition/body-site link. The individual maps show one trait and one profile direction per figure. Curve width is the focus-direction positive-z profile count for that trait and shade is the mean positive focus-profile z-score within that trait's monochrome scale. Light grey underlays show the z <= 0 background for the same condition/body-site/trait link.

Image node keys spell out the compact labels used in the PNGs: `n=` is positive-z focus-profile support, `s=` is the unique study count for `n`, `bg=` is z <= 0 background-profile support, `links=` is plotted trait-specific link count, and `traits=` is the number of distinct traits represented at a combined-map node.

Node counts are profile-trait memberships across displayed links, not deduplicated profile totals. Use the edge TSVs for exact trait-specific counts, study IDs, raw rolled-up labels, and increased-minus-decreased contrasts.
